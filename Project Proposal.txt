1. Prepare a 1–2 page project proposal document that includes the following sections:

Problem statement and target users

Proposed solution and key features

Technical stack (APIs, frameworks, databases)

System architecture diagram

Success criteria and evaluation metrics

The proposal should clearly describe the project idea and demonstrate feasibility within the course timeline.

Include a system architecture diagram (can be created using Draw.io, Lucidchart, PowerPoint, Google Slides, etc.) and embed it in the proposal document.

Upload the proposal as a PDF or DOC/DOCX file to this Canvas assignment.

Instructor feedback will be provided after submission. Instructor approval is required to proceed with the project.

As part of this assignment, students must make commits to their project repository and submit a short (1-page) report describing the work completed for this milestone on Canvas.
